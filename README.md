This code defines four AI agents using the Agno library:

1. `newsAgent`: gathers news from different sources.
2. `web_agent`: gathers information on a company's financials, news, and other relevant information using DuckDuckGo search.
3. `finance_agent`: analyzes Indian listed companies' stock prices, analyst recommendations, and fundamentals using YFinance tools.
4. `agent_team`: a team of the above three agents, which provides a comprehensive response to a question.

The agents are then used to answer the question "Based on current scenario, which stocks are best to buy?" and print the response in real-time.
